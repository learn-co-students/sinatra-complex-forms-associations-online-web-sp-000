  <% end %> <!-- the checkbox has a name of "owner[pet_ids][]" because we want to structure our params hash such that the array of pet IDs is stored inside the "owner" hash. We are aiming to associate the pets that have these IDs with the new owner -->
  <br> <!-- we give the checkbox an id of the given pet's ID so that our Capybara test can find the checkbox using the pet's ID -->

<!-- here we have a basic form for a new owner with a field for that new owner's name -->
<!-- however, we want our users to be able to cerate an owner and select existing pets to associate with that new owner at the same time -->
<!-- so, our form should include a list of checkboxes, one for each existing pet, for our user to select from at will -->
